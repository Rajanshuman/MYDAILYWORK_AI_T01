# Build a simple chatbot that responds to user inputs based onpredefined rules. Use if-else statements or pattern matchingtechniques to identify user queries and provide appropriateresponses. This will give you a basic understanding of natural language processing and conversation flow.

In the evolving field of Artificial Intelligence, chatbots stand out as both accessible and practical tools. Specifically, rule-based chatbots, enriched with Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, provide a robust solution for handling customer queries efficiently.

# Prerequisites for Developing a Chatbot
 Before delving into chatbot construction, certain foundational skills and environments need to be established:

 Programming Skills: Proficiency in Python is crucial, including an understanding of control structures, functions, and object-oriented programming (OOP).
 Regular Expressions (Regex): Essential for pattern matching within user inputs to ensure dynamic response handling.
 Natural Language Processing (NLP): Familiarity with tokenization, stemming, lemmatization, and part-of-speech tagging is necessary for processing and understanding human language.
